## BloxAdder
# What is it?
BloxAdder is a simple C# program for mac that copies files from the BloxAdder Folder to Roblox.app/Contents/Resources/ . It runs in the background but because it is single threaded and doesn't have a UI, it will say it is not responding!

I created BloxAdder to solve the issue of having my custom avatar catalog place reset back to the basic Roblox avatar catalog place every update. This program can for example automatically copy it into the files so I can easily keep it!

# How do I use it?

In your Applications folder create a new folder call BloxAdder, and for there you can add subfolder and files that will copy into Roblox.app/Contents/Resources.

An example of the program copies files:

```/Application/BloxAdder/ExtraContent/places/Mobile.rblx -> /Applications/Roblox.app/ExtraContent/places/Mobile.rblx```

This automatically will be copied if it doesn't exist or is modified/changed!

# Note!!!
Not sure it you can exploit with it but please don't try because it is against Roblox's TOS and ruins the game for other people.
